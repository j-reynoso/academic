Parser program

This program **takes in a text file** and parses and tokenizes the words from the symbols and is **able to verify if it is grammatically valid** according to a **grammar defined within the file**. 

This project was assigned as part of a **Programming Languages** course, and the specific files implemented by myself, Jasmin Reynoso, are Parser.C and Tokenizer.c.



**Parser.c** is a recursive-descent predictive parser which utilizes single-symbol lookahead.

**Tokenizer.c** takes in the file of text and create different tokens of the groups of alphanumeric lexemes and symbols and adds it to an array of lexeme structures passed to the function.
