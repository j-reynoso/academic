Calculator program

This program **takes in user input through command line** and parses and tokenizes the symbols and **assigns values to variables and perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication** on these variables. 

There is **error handling** in the situation that the user attempts to calculate using an **undefined variable**.

This project was assigned as part of an **Algorithm Analysis** course, and the entire code was implemented by myself, Jasmin Reynoso.
